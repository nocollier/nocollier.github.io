## Codes

* International Land Model Benchmarking ([ILAMB](https://bitbucket.org/ncollier/ilamb/)): a python package which is designed to systemtically compare Earth system model output to a collection of observational data. See sample [output](https://www.ilamb.org/CMIP5v6/historical/) to get an idea for what the package does.
* Terrestrial Dynamics Core ([TDycore](https://github.com/TDycores-Project/TDycore)): a C library with Fortran/python interfaces based on [PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) which implements a partial different equation solver designed to solve Richards equation efficiently on the global scale.
* [PetIGA](https://bitbucket.org/dalcinl/petiga): a finite element framework implemented as a C library built on top of [PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/). While primarily intended to be used for single patch isogeometric spaces, we also implement traditional spaces.
* [igakit](https://bitbucket.org/dalcinl/igakit): a python package used to pre/post-process data to be used with PetIGA.
* A Massively Parallel Reactive Flow and Transport Model for describing Subsurface Processes ([PFLOTRAN](https://www.pflotran.org/)): a Fortran-based code for solving flow and reactive transport.
